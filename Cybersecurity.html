    <p id="when">So first, When did I start?</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 3em;">So, I started learning cybersecurity near the 22nd of Febuary 2025 as the image below shows and been learning red teaming recently</p>
    <img src="https://github.com/MrSpaghettiOk/UK-website-school-project/raw/main/Capture%20d'%C3%A9cran%202025-10-05%20202351.png">
    <p id="why">Second, Why cybersecurity? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 3em;">Because:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>I like computers</li>
    <li>I like programming and heard you do that sometimes</li>
    <li>I like to analyse</li>
    <li>I saw that some malicious people attacked a hospital and felt really bad for the families so I wanted to protect them</li>
    </ol>
    <p id="how">Thirdly, How?</p>
    <p>So at first I started on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a>because I saw an ad on Instagram, then I saw that it was pretty basic knowledge and discovered <a href="https://tryhackme.com">TryHackMe,</a>at around the same time I saw <a href="https://www.hackthebox.com/">HackTheBox</a>but I quicly realised that I was limited by the VM time so i decided to install a Kali Linux VM and very recently (like 10 days ago at time of writing) I discovered <a href="https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/">the bandit wargames on OverTheWire, </a>though i knew about OTW before I had no idea on how to play, and with my Linux knowledge acquired thanks to my kali VM I find it very easy</p>
    <p id="where">And finally, Where did I start to learn?</p>
    <p>Let's be honest, everytime I could, even watching youtube videos or reading articles on a new data leak for example, even today, Im redaing a book called "The Art Of Intrusion", so im learning everyday even through stories</p>
